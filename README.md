# SRUP

## Secure Remote Update Protocol
The Secure Remote Update Protocol (SRUP) is a secure & confirmable command-and-control (C2) protocol for the Internet of Things (IoT), based on MQTT.

SRUP is designed to provide an easy way to communicate details of a required software update to an IoT device – but it's not limited just software updates; the protocol can be extended to support any type of C2 message.

**This software is the output of PhD research; and whilst appropriate due diligence has been carried out in terms of quality assurance – this software is not a formal Dstl output; please see the terms of release as outlined in the MIT Licence within this repository..**
